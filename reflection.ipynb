    "- In the preprocessing step, to handle missing values, it was hard to decide which methods of filling were suitable. The numerical columns didn't have normal distribution (mostly heavily left-skewed due to outliers).\n",
    "- Normalizing data was also challenging due to the wide ranges of the numerical columns, if not handled carefully, it might lead to poor modeling performance.\n",
